#NBA's Top Players according to total Raptor Ratin and the breakdown of their rating using FiveThirtyEight Offensive/Defensive Raptor Ratings 


I retrieved my Data from fivethirtyeight.com which keeps stats on professional sports. They have created a "Raptor rating" in order to assign players performance a single value. My visualization depicts a scatterplot with players with a raptor score above 5. 

TODO: Put visualization here


On the x axis is there raptor rating for offense and their raptor rating for defense. There is a strong negative relationship between the two scores. As the offensive raptor score increases the defensive raptor score decreases and vice versa. This is because players only have so much energy, it is hard to have both a high defensive raptor score and offensive raptor score in one player.
